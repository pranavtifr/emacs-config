# emacs-config
The Name says it all. 

The Purpose of this repo is to have a extremely beginner friendly configuration process to 
emacs using the power of org-mode. It loads a lot of packages which I think are really useful for
someone who is not a regular programmer. 

It is made so such that, various factors can just be turned off and on by using the comment function of org-mode.

This repo is definitely not as much fun as playing with the config files yourself, but if it makes some beginner try out emacs
without worrying about the initial configuration. I will be happy.
